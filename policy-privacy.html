                            </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                              commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                              to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                              stored on your device's internal memory.
                            </p> <p>
                              This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                              the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
                              “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                              You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies

                              I may employ third-party companies and
                              individuals due to the following reasons:

                              Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                              them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                              disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                              I value your trust in providing us your
                              Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                              acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                              of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                              storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                              guarantee its absolute security.
                            </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                              This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                              a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                              that these external sites are not operated by me.
                              Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                              Privacy Policy of these websites. I have

                                identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                                me with personal information, I immediately
                                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                                and you are aware that your child has provided us with

                                I will be able to do the necessary actions.
